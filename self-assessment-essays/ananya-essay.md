# Capstone Self-Assessment Essay

## Introduction
The project aims to harness the power of voice assistants in order to deliver insights from large datasets. The end product will be an Alexa Skill and a Google Action that uses natural language processing techniques to convert a conversational request into a suitable query that can parse through the dataset and obtain relevant insights. An example of this, 'Which month had the lowest amount of stationery sales in Michigan last year?', needs to combine all pen sales, notebook sales, etc. and understand that 'last year' refers to 2017 in order to come up with a single number. To answer the query in a timely manner, the data must be sifted through quickly. Data Cubes will be used to accomplish this. The final component of the project will be using AWS lambda functions and other cloud computing resources to work with data cubes.

## Relevant College Experiences
The Computer Science curriculum at UC has played an important role in acquiring the technical skills required to develop this project. Data Structures (CS 2028), Discrete Structures (CS 2071), and Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 4071) have formed the foundation of my coding abilities and will help me think through a project of this scale. Software Engineering (EECE 3093) introduced me to concepts such as agile methodology and the labs in the course gave me practical experience in coming up with user stories and design diagrams. Linear Algebra (MATH 2076) gave me the necessary understanding of matrices and their operations, which is required for working with large datasets and machine learning algorithms. Finally, Natural Language Processing (CS 5134) taught me the NLP techniques and methodologies, and also introduced machine learning concepts, both of which I will apply to the Alexa Skill and Google Action portion of my senior design project. Overall, my courses at UC have prepared me well for this project, and classes I am currently taking, such as Information Retrieval (CS 5154) and User Interfaces (CS 5167) will also augment my abilities.

## Relevant Co-op Experiences - TODO
During the course of my degree, I have completed three co-ops at three different companies. My first co-op as Software Developer Intern at RSW/US taught me about everything that goes into building a software development project from scratch, including working with the full stack and making decisions about which technologies to use. At my next two co-ops at Software Major (as a Software Developer Intern) and Goldman Sachs (as a Summer Technology Analyst), I learnt how to work in a team with other software developers, designers and supervisors. I also had the opportunity to learn how to take simple requirements and convert them into a completed project.
