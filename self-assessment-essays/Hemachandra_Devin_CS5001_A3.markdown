# Capstone Self-Assessment


## Project Introduction
Our project is about being able to find valuable information from large amounts of data. The user would ideally interact through an existing voice assistant such as Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant. Natural Language Processing would be used to convert the user's question into a query that can parse the data and obtain relevant information. We'd need to ensure that the voice assistant can recognize conversational words or phrases such as 'last year', 'him' etc from context. Data cubes will be used to ensure the large amounts of data could be parsed in a relatively short amount of time. Finally, Amazon AWS lambda or other cloud computing platforms will be used to use the data cubes.


## Experience

### College
As a Computer Science major, several classes included in the curriculum helped gain the necessary expertise for this project. Regarding technical skills, Data Structures (CS2028) was the basis for programming and helped me understand concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming. Through Linear Algebra (MATH2076) I was able to understand vector and matrix operations which are a frequent component of machine learning. Natural Language Processing (CS5134) and Intelligent Data Analysis (CS5152) will help with machine learning and working with large datasets, both of which are required for the project. Other classes such as Technical Writing (ENGL) and Public Speaking () have helped with  writing technical documentation and presenting or pitching the project at various stages efficiently. Future courses such as Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CS 4071) and Deep Learning () will improve my programming through concepts such as complexity and using neural networks in the machine learning.

### Co-op
I have worked at two companies as a software engineer. My first was AK Steel where I had to design user interfaces, update and maintain websites and work with SQL databases. At Fortech LLC, I was working on the same areas with different tech stacks. In both co-ops I gained significant experienc in web development, both front and back end which will definitely help with the web app of the project. In both coops I had to learn new technology and languages on my own for the most part, this will help when I have to learn new technology that might be used in the project. Both co-ops also improved my ability to work according to given deadlines, which will also benefit here.



## Motivation
I have always been interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particulary since they are newer areas of computer science and open to improvement. Given this, I was primarily seeking to work on a project which would give me hand-on experience in a field I have not had much experience in. At the same time, I wanted to be able to apply the web development skills I had acquired over my time as an undergraduate student both in class and through co-ops. I would also be able to apply the skills of ML/NLP that I have gained through courses at UC and online. I was also seeking a project that would also help improve my career options by giving me experience valuable to employers.


## Preliminary approach
The project will be divided into three main parts with a different team member working primarily on one task. The division was based on relevant experience each member had toward each task. Natural language processing, data processing and web development will be the main tasks. For my part, the focus will be on the web app, the goal being an efficient and user-friendly end product. We expect to have a final product where each task works well individually and with the other two. Our evaluation will be based on this as well as any feedback received by advisors and other outsiders who test out the product.
