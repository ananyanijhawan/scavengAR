## Background Description
As organizations adopt big data and machine learning into their core products and services, there has been an increasing trend of collecting data to mine and derive insights from that data. To access these massive stores of data, many popular data libraries provide the use of special query languages for querying, updating, deleting the data, etc. While these are useful, it has become difficult to keep track of these data technologies and query languages. Moreover, the access to these technologies is limited to developers and data analysts as they are the only ones well versed with the technicalities of languages and frameworks like MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, etc. Someone (say a CEO or a student or a doctor) without the technical know-how would find it difficult to derive simple insights and would have to seek outside help and investment to learn about their own data.   

## Problem Statement
As mentioned before, there is no simple way to derive insights about data. We believe that those who own the data should be able to learn more about it themselves. Or at least be able to get the basic information about it. To tackle this, we sought to find the most human and simple form of collecting data: conversation. We use our natural language and interactions to learn about our world. We should be able to do the same with data. A CEO who has runs a shoe sales company should simply be able to ask the computer, "Which cities have the lowest sales figures on the west coast?"

Basically, there are no voice based apps that allow derivation of simple insights from large datasets in a conversational manner.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Some current solutions exist in the form of data visualization libraries like PowerBI and Tableau, which come with many crowded features and need a powerful platform to work on. Even then, they simply provide visualizations, not the insights themselves - those have to be painstakingly derived by the users. Again, this makes data analysis for a simple task more complex and time consuming than it has to be. For example, a CEO should not have to wait for a data analyst or complex data software to give back the lowest sales. A simple back-and-forth Q and A should suffice.

## Background Skills and Interest
**Background Skills:** We have experience in full stack web development, machine learning, natural language processing, and Alexa skill development.

**Interest:** We are interested in adding to our skillsets and are looking forward to dabbling in voice user interfaces as well as processing large datasets.

## Approach, Goals and Expectations
**Primary Goals**
* Create web app to upload data sets in supported file formats
* Create Alexa skill and teach it commands that user might ask
* Connect Alexa skill with the dataset using a AWS Lambda
* Use data cubes and NLP techniques to sift through data and return relevant answers

**Stretch Goals**
* Create a similar version with Google voice assistant
* Ability to handle massive amounts of data
* Create web app to show the process
