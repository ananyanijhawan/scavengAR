# Project Milestones

* `Upload dataset to Web App:` The Web App accepts datasets from the user in all supported formats and prepares it for processing.

* `Create data cubes from dataset:` The Web App interface takes in data cube specifications, which are then used to create data cubes that can be queried via ANSI SQL.

* `Convert queries to SQL and back:` Queries are parsed via POS Tagging with the help of WordNet, and converted to corresponding SQL queries. Results of the SQL queries are converted to natural language sentences.

* `Query Alexa successfully:` The user verbally asks Alexa queries about the dataset and receives an appropriate verbal response within 7 seconds.

* `Query Web App successfully:` The user types in a query into the Web App and receives a response in the form of English sentences or a small data table as appropriate.

* `Test code:` All aspects of the code, including the Web App, data processing and NLP components are tested by unit and integration tests.
