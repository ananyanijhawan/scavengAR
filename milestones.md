# Project Milestones

1. Upload dataset to Web App:
    The Web App accepts datasets from the user in all supported formats and prepares it for processing.
2. Create data cubes from dataset:
    The Web App interface takes in data cube specifications, which are then used to create data cubes that can be queried via ANSI SQL.
3. Convert sample queries to SQL and back:
    Queries are parsed via POS Tagging with the help of WordNet, and converted to corresponding SQL queries. Results of the SQL queries are converted to natural language sentences.
4. Query Alexa successfully
    The user verbally asks Alexa queries about the dataset and receives an appropriate verbal response within 7 seconds.
5. Query Web App successfully
    The user types in a query into the Web App and receives a response in the form of English sentences or a small data table as appropriate.
6. Test code
    All aspects of the code, including the Web App, data processing and NLP components are tested by unit and integration tests.
